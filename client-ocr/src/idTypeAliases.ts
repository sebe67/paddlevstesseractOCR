 * Keyword lists for classifying which PH ID type a card is, and for locating each
 * field's printed label (English + Filipino) so its value can be pulled from the
 * OCR'd text lines nearby. These lists are a starting point — expand them as you
 * test against real cards, especially PHILSYS/UMID/PRC/POSTAL/VOTERS/SSS/TIN/
 * PHILHEALTH, which weren't in the original PaddleOCR-vs-Tesseract benchmark.
 *
 * SENIOR_CITIZEN and PWD are issued per-LGU (city/municipality), not by one national
 * agency, so their physical layout and label wording vary far more than the other
 * types here — expect lower field-recall for those two regardless of tuning.
